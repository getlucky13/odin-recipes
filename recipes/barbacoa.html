    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Traditionally a Sunday morning treat, but barbacoa is great any morning. 
        Barbacoa can be for the more adventurous, but a real treat none-the-less. 
        I do not recommend substituting the cheek meat with roast, it won't taste right. 
        Barbacoa has a certain gelatinous slide and tack that is the hallmark of the genre. 
        Serve on tortillas with hot sauce and chopped cilantro.</p>
